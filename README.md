# Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

A small project that implements a **two-layer neural network from scratch using NumPy** and trains it on the **Two Moons** binary classification dataset.

What this demonstrates:
- forward propagation
- binary cross-entropy loss
- manual backpropagation (no autograd)
- gradient descent updates
- decision boundary visualization

## What it does
- Generate a non-linearly separable 2D dataset (two moons)
- Split into train/test (75% / 25%) and standardize features
- Train a simple fully-connected neural network to separate class 0 vs class 1
- Visualize training loss and the learned decision boundary
